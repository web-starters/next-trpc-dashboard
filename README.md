# next-trpc-dashboard

This is a starter for dashboard applications. It was created using the solutions of [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and extended with useful things such as `themes`, `internationalization`, `atomic design`, `unit tests` configuration and nice design.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

> You have to create an `.env` file in the root directory like `.env.example` file.

```shell script
pnpm dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
